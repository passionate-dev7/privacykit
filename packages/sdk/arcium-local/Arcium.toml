# This configuration is used for running a local MPC cluster for development and testing

# Minimum 2 nodes required for MPC computations

# MPC backends this MXE supports
# Supported values: "Cerberus", "Manticore", or both
# Cerberus is the default and recommended for most use cases
# Manticore is an alternative backend for specific use cases

# Required when backends includes "Manticore"
# Each path is copied to corresponding node's artifacts/manticore/computation_folder_N
# Example: manticore_data_folders = ["./data/player-0", "./data/player-1"]
# manticore_data_folders = []
